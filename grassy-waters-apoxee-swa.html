				<p>The backbone of these trails is the 20 mile Owahee Trail along the levee containing Palm Beach County's water reservior.  While most reserviors are lakes, here on the edge of the Everglades, the water is stored in a shallow wetland over many acres.  The proximity of all this water combined with the food source found at a nearby active landfill create a popular spot for wildlife.  The dump is mostly out of sight and smell.  Views from the trail include cypress stands, canals, and everglades.  Wildlife spotted here include deer, bobcat, otters, racoons, alligators, Roseate Spoonbills, herons, Wood Storks, and many other birds. 
					</p>
				
				<p>The surface of the Owahee Trail is a mixture of sand and shellrock.  There are usually a few loose sandy spots.  Mountain bike tires are recommended.  Connecting to the Owahee trail is a network of wide nature trails created and maintained by the Solid Waste Authority.  These trails are shellrock and suitable for narrower tires or those wanting a shorter, easier ride.
